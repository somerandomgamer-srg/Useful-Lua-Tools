# Useful Lua Tools

## (A message from the creator)

### About Me
Hello, I am SRG. SRG is short for (Some Random Gamer). I have been scripting for less than a year. I know how to:
- Code with Lua
- Code with Luau, a sub-version of Lua that was specifically made for Roblox
- Make datastores with SQL

I originally got into coding because of my friend Michialok. I started coding in Roblox and self-taught myself most of the things I know.
I have taken 4 or 5 Computer Science classes (I forgot the actual amount). I've taken 3 different Engineering classes and I am currently in another one as I'm typing this (Probably should focus more on my class but I'm doing fine).
I can barely code with Python and I'm also planning to learn Javascript.

Career Choices: I am planning to be some type of Engineer or Programmer.

## Library Features

This library extends Lua's standard libraries with additional functionality:

### Math Extensions
- Statistical functions (average, median, mode, etc.)
- Number theory functions (GCD, LCM, prime checking)
- Quadratic equation solving
- Hyperbolic functions
- Number utilities (rounding, Fibonacci, odd/even checking)

### String Extensions
- String cleaning and formatting
- Text manipulation (trim, split, case conversion)
- Pattern matching helpers

### Table Extensions
- Advanced table operations
- CSV conversion
- Table manipulation (reverse, shuffle)
- Key counting and deep inspection

### Input Library
- User input handling
- Multiple input collection
- Numeric input validation
- Input looping

### Cryptography
- Text format conversion (ASCII, Hex, Binary, Morse)
- Encryption methods (XOR, Caesar cipher, ROT13)
- Bitwise operations

### Global Utilities
- Timing and benchmarking
- Type checking
- System operations

## Usage

1. Include the library files in your project
```lua
  require("Useful Lua Tools")
```
3. Access the extended functionality through the standard Lua libraries
4. Check `help.md` for detailed documentation and examples

## Getting Started

```lua
-- Example usage
local numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(math.average(numbers))  -- Output: 3

local text = "  Hello World  "
print(string.trim(text))  -- Output: "Hello World"

-- More examples in help.md
```
