### About Me
Hello, I am SRG. SRG is short for (Some Random Gamer). I have been scripting for less than a year. I know how to:
- Code with Lua
- Code with Luau, a sub-version of Lua that was specifically made for Roblox
- Make datastores with SQL
I originally got into coding because of my friend Michialok. I started coding in Roblox and self-taught myself most of the things I know.
I have taken 4 or 5 Computer Science classes (I forgot the actual amount). I've taken 3 different Engineering classes and I am currently in another one as I'm typing this (Probably should focus more on my class but I'm doing fine).
I can barely code with Python and I'm also planning to learn Javascript.

Career Choices: I am planning to be some type of Engineer or Programmer.

# Usage
