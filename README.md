## (A message from the creator)
### About Me
Hello, I am SRG (short for `Some Random Gamer`).
- I have been into coding for about a year.
- I know how to:
  - Code with Lua
  - Code with Luau, a sub-version of Lua that was specifically made for Roblox
  - Make datastores with SQL
- I originally got into coding because of my friend Michialok.
- I started coding in Roblox and self-taught myself most of the things I know.
- I have taken 5 Computer Science classes.
- I've taken 4 different Engineering classes.
- I can barely code with Python.
- I'm planning to learn Javascript.

## Usage
Nothing much to say here.

1. Require the main file:
```lua
